            One of Irvine's most desirable established communities, Woodbridge features mature landscaping, two private lakes, 
            and a strong sense of community. Properties range from condos and townhomes to single-family detached homes.

            Known for its hillside location and stunning views, Turtle Rock offers luxury homes with resort-style amenities. 
            Properties often require jumbo financing, and the unique topography and custom features require appraisers 
            familiar with hillside valuations and luxury amenities like pools and view premiums.

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">University Park</h3>

            Irvine's newest major development offers modern homes with contemporary designs and amenities. 
            Properties typically include Mello-Roos taxes that must be factored into debt-to-income calculations. 
            New construction considerations may apply, and lenders must understand the developing community infrastructure and future build-out plans.

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Cypress Village</h3>

            Properties may include additional assessments for community amenities, and the newer development status
