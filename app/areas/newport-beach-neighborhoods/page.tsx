            One of Newport Beach's most prestigious addresses, Balboa Island features charming waterfront homes with boat docks. 
            Properties typically require super jumbo financing, and lenders must understand unique features like shared docks,

          <p className="mb-3">
            This exclusive gated island community features luxury homes with private docks and bay access. Financing requires 
            lenders experienced with high-value waterfront properties, understanding of community amenities like the yacht club, 
            and appreciation for the limited inventory that drives premium valuations.
          </p>
