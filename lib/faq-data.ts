    question: "What does a mortgage broker do?",
    answer: "A mortgage broker acts as an intermediary between borrowers and multiple lenders. Unlike banks that only offer their own loan products, mortgage brokers have access to 200+ lenders and can shop your loan to find the best rates, terms, and loan programs that match your specific financial situation. Brokers handle the entire loan process from application to closing, saving you time and potentially thousands of dollars."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does a mortgage broker cost in Orange County?",
    answer: "In most cases, mortgage brokers are paid by the lender, not the borrower, meaning their services are typically free to you. The lender pays the broker a commission (usually 1-2% of the loan amount) after your loan closes successfully. This means you get access to multiple lenders and expert guidance at no direct cost, while often securing better rates than going directly to a single bank."
  },
  {
    question: "What credit score is needed to qualify for a mortgage in Orange County?",
    answer: "Credit score requirements vary by loan type: FHA loans accept scores as low as 580 with 3.5% down (or 500 with 10% down), conventional loans typically require 620+, VA loans are flexible with no strict minimum, and jumbo loans usually need 700+. However, higher scores (740+) get the best rates. Even with lower scores, experienced brokers can find loan programs that work for your situation."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does the mortgage process take with a broker?",
    answer: "The typical mortgage process takes 25-45 days from application to closing. Pre-approval can be completed in 1-3 business days. Working with an experienced broker can actually speed up the process because they know which lenders work best for your situation, have established relationships, and can navigate any issues quickly. They also handle most of the paperwork and communication for you."
  },
  {
    question: "What are the benefits of using a mortgage broker vs. going directly to a bank?",
    answer: "Mortgage brokers offer several key advantages: access to 200+ lenders vs. one bank's products, competitive shopping for the best rates and terms, expert guidance through complex loan programs, personalized service throughout the process, and often better rates than retail banks. Brokers work for you, not the lender, ensuring you get the loan that best fits your needs and financial goals."

// FHA Loan specific FAQs
export const fhaLoanFAQs: FAQItem[] = [
  {
    question: "What is the minimum down payment for FHA loans in Orange County?",
    answer: "FHA loans require as little as 3.5% down payment if your credit score is 580 or higher. If your credit score is between 500-579, you'll need 10% down.

  },
  {
    question: "What is mortgage insurance on FHA loans and how much does it cost?",

For most borrowers, the annual premium is 0.85% of the loan amount. Unlike conventional PMI, FHA mortgage insurance typically stays for the life of the loan, but it enables homeownership with lower down payments and credit scores."
  },

  },
  {
    question: "What is the VA funding fee and can it be financed?",

This fee can be financed into the loan amount, so no upfront payment is required. Veterans with service-connected disabilities are exempt from the funding fee."
  },

  },
  {
    question: "Can I use my VA loan benefit multiple times?",
    answer: "Yes, VA loan benefits are reusable. You can use them again after selling your previous home or by having sufficient remaining entitlement. Some veterans can even have two VA loans simultaneously. This makes VA benefits extremely valuable for Orange County military families who may move or want to keep rental properties."

// HELOC specific FAQs
export const helocFAQs: FAQItem[] = [
  {
    question: "How much can I borrow with a HELOC on my Orange County home?",
    answer: "Most lenders allow you to borrow up to 80-90% of your home's current value minus your existing mortgage balance.

Current rates are generally lower than credit cards or personal loans, making HELOCs cost-effective for major expenses."

  },
  {
    question: "How do HELOC payments work?",
    answer: "HELOCs typically have a 10-year draw period where you pay interest-only on amounts borrowed, followed by a 10-20 year repayment period with principal and interest. During the draw period, you can borrow, repay, and re-borrow as needed. This flexibility makes HELOCs ideal for ongoing projects or expenses."

// Refinancing specific FAQs
export const refinancingFAQs: FAQItem[] = [
  {
    question: "When should I consider refinancing my Orange County home?",
    answer: "Consider refinancing when rates drop 0.5-1% below your current rate, when your credit has improved significantly, to eliminate PMI, to switch from adjustable to fixed rate, or to access home equity through cash-out refinancing.

  },
  {
    question: "What are the costs involved in refinancing?",
    answer: "Refinancing costs typically range from 2-5% of the loan amount, including appraisal, title insurance, and lender fees. For a $800,000 loan, expect $16,000-$40,000 in costs. However, these can often be rolled into the new loan amount, and the monthly savings often offset costs within 1-3 years."
  },
  {
    question: "How much equity do I need to refinance?",
    answer: "Most lenders require at least 20% equity to avoid mortgage insurance on a refinance. With Orange County's property appreciation, many homeowners have substantial equity.

  },
  {
    question: "How long does the refinancing process take?",
